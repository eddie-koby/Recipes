        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Aebleskiver is a Danish dessert, like doughnut holes, but sweeter and much better. It's traditionally
                 served with glogg during the Advent and cooked in a cast iron pan that resembles an egg poacher. Serve
                  hot with syrup, jam, or powdered sugar.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>2 large egg whites</li>
                <li>2 cups buttermilk</li>
                <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
                <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Beat egg whites in a clean glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until stiff
                     peaks form. Set aside.</li>
                <li>Mix together buttermilk, flour, egg yolks, melted butter, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and
                     salt in a large bowl; beat until smooth. Gently fold in egg whites.</li>
                <li>Heat an aebleskiver pan over medium heat. Put about 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in the bottom 
                    of each cup.</li>
                <li>Pour about 2 tablespoons batter into each prepared cup. As soon as bubbles appear around the edges,
                     turn them quickly. (Danish cooks use a long knitting needle, but a fork will work.) Continue cooking,
                      turning the ball to keep it from burning.</li>
            </ol>
