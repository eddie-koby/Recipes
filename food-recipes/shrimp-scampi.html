        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>This classic recipe makes a simple garlic, white wine and butter sauce that goes well with a 
                pile of pasta or with a hunk of crusty bread.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 lb linguini</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>4 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling</li>
                <li>2 shallots, finely diced</li>
                <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 pound shrimp, peeled and deveined</li>
                <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
                <li>1/2 cup dry white wine</li>
                <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
                <li>1/4 cup finely chopped parsley leaves</li>
                <li>Pinch red pepper flakes, optional</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>For the pasta, put a large pot of water on the stove to boil. When it has come to the boil, add a couple of 
                    tablespoons of salt and the linguini. Stir to make sure the pasta separates; cover. When the water returns to 
                    a boil, cook for about 6 to 8 minutes or until the pasta is not quite done. Drain the pasta</li>
                <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet, melt 2 tablespoons butter in 2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high heat. 
                    Saute the shallots, garlic, and red pepper flakes (if using) until the shallots are translucent, about 3 to 4 
                    minutes. Season the shrimp with salt and pepper; add them to the pan and cook until they have turned pink, about 
                    2 to 3 minutes. Remove the shrimp from the pan; set aside and keep warm. Add wine and lemon juice and bring to a 
                    boil. Add 2 tablespoons butter and 2 tablespoons oil. When the butter has melted, return the shrimp to the pan along
                     with the parsley and cooked pasta. Stir well and season with salt and pepper. Drizzle over a bit more olive oil and
                      serve immediately.</li>
